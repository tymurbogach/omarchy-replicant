# shellcheck shell=bash disable=SC2034
# categories.sh: the areas that the panel files every entry under.
# Sourced by replicant-core.sh, which sets the paths it uses. It defines
# functions and data and runs nothing. Other modules read its data.

# ─── CATEGORIES — how the panel files everything, and how each is put back ───
# The panel shows one collapsed card per category instead of one long list of
# 40 files, so nothing needs a long scroll. `method` is the honest answer to
# "what will Replicant actually run to restore this?" — it is shown in the UI
# rather than hidden in the code, because using the Omarchy-sanctioned path
# (omarchy theme set, omarchy plugin add, hyprctl reload) instead of blindly
# copying files back is the whole point of this plugin.
#
# Format: "id|icon|label|description|method"
